## Welcome & Why AI Security Will Change Cyber Security

Organisations are adopting AI at speed - but **security is being left behind**.

Traditional cyber security methods are not designed to address the **unique threats posed by AI**. From model manipulation to adversarial prompts, the risks are growing - and so is the divide between cyber professionals and AI developers.

### Why This Matters:
-  Traditional cyber security falls short when faced with AI-specific attack vectors such as model inversion, data poisoning, and prompt injection.
-  The gap between security professionals and ML engineers is **widening**.
-  AI is often deployed without a **secure-by-design approach**, exposing businesses to significant risk.
-  The rapid pace of AI adoption demands a **new security mindset** and **specialised tools**.
